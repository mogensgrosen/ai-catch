      <section>
        <h2>1. Change as Structured Problem‑Solving</h2>
        <p>Traditional approaches often see change as a series of isolated reactions to top-down command and management decions. Change as Structured Problem Solving see change as systemic decision processes handling internal and external complexity in an organisation. This is based on three main aspects. 
      </p>

        <p><strong>Firstly, </strong> it is based on the idea that each area or function  within the organization (strategy and leadership, production, support and capability development) takes ownership of its own challenges by observing both internal and external contexts, fostering distributed responsibility rather than centralized control. Note: the strategy and leadership function has its own tasks, including preparing the strategy and making sure that the distributed responsibility is working. 
        </p>
    
        <p><strong>Secondly, </strong> it is based on a problem-solving process, where each part of an organization describes issues and current situation, uses AI-CATCH to provide solution alternatives and chooses a suitable solution. This process relies on collaboration involving other parts of the organization. 
          </p>

        <p><strong>Thirdly, </strong>it is based on tailored industry standards and best practices to be used by the organization to guide the processes and provide common terminology. The common terminology is used to describe the current situation but also used by AI when preparing solution alternatives. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Using this approach implies that solutions are discussed and selected decentral, in collaboration with other parts of the organization, taking internal and external complexity, best practices and standards into account. This ensures that solutions are goal-oriented, context-sensitive and sustainable. 
        </p>

        <h2>2. AI as an Exploratory Partner</h2>
        <p>Generative AI broadens thinking. It mines standards, cases, and internal docs to suggest options you might miss. Humans stay in charge—assessing and refining ideas—while AI speeds insight and widens the solution space.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Transform Generic Knowledge into Context‑Specific Advice</h2>
        <p>Generic frameworks (GSBPM, GAMSO, UN NQAF) are powerful but abstract. AI-CATCH adapts them to your context—strategy, culture, constraints—so recommendations resonate and are implementable.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>4. Co‑Creation with Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Real change sticks when people own it. Workshops integrate AI suggestions with expert judgment from across the organization. This participatory design builds trust, relevance, and practical solutions.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>5. Sustaining Change (Memory &amp; Feedback Loops)</h2>
        <p>AI-CATCH documents decisions, rationales, and follow-ups, creating institutional memory. Embedded monitoring and iterative reviews keep improvements alive and evolving.</p>
